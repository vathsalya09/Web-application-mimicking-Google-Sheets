Solution

This project implements a web-based spreadsheet application mimicking Google Sheets' core functionalities and UI, using React for the frontend and a Node.js backend. The grid interface allows users to input and edit data, apply formulas, and format cells. It supports essential mathematical functions like SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and COUNT, as well as data quality operations like TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, and FIND_AND_REPLACE.

The frontend uses React state to dynamically manage cell data, dependencies, and formula evaluation, ensuring real-time updates across the grid. Basic cell reference parsing (e.g., A1:B2) is implemented for range-based operations. A toolbar provides easy access to formulas and cell formatting options. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, enables saving and loading spreadsheets, while Chart.js integration can extend functionality for data visualization.

Data validation ensures cells accept only appropriate input types, while the modular codebase allows for easy addition of new formulas and features. The app is styled for a clean and familiar user interface, replicating Google Sheets' layout. This lightweight, functional MVP can be expanded with features like user authentication, collaborative editing, and advanced charting for broader use cases.

Here's the database design for the Google Sheets clone, focusing on storing spreadsheet data, including sheets, rows, cells, and user-related information.

Database Schema
We'll use a relational database like SQLite or PostgreSQL. The design is modular to support saving/loading spreadsheets, managing users, and adding additional features in the future.

1. users Table
Stores user-related information for authentication and personalization.

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique identifier for the user.
username	VARCHAR(50)	User's name.
email	VARCHAR(100)	User's email address.
password	VARCHAR(255)	Hashed password for authentication.
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Account creation date.
2. spreadsheets Table
Stores metadata for spreadsheets.

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique spreadsheet identifier.
user_id	INT (FK)	Links to the users table.
name	VARCHAR(100)	Name of the spreadsheet.
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Spreadsheet creation timestamp.
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Last updated timestamp.
3. sheets Table
Represents individual sheets (tabs) within a spreadsheet.

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique sheet identifier.
spreadsheet_id	INT (FK)	Links to the spreadsheets table.
name	VARCHAR(50)	Name of the sheet (e.g., "Sheet1").
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Sheet creation timestamp.
4. cells Table
Stores individual cell data for each sheet.

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique cell identifier.
sheet_id	INT (FK)	Links to the sheets table.
row	INT	Row number of the cell (e.g., 1).
col	INT	Column number of the cell (e.g., 2).
value	TEXT	The value in the cell.
formula	TEXT	Formula applied to the cell (if any).
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Cell creation timestamp.
5. cell_dependencies Table
Tracks dependencies between cells for formula updates (e.g., if cell B1 depends on A1).

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique dependency identifier.
source_cell_id	INT (FK)	Cell ID the formula depends on.
dependent_cell_id	INT (FK)	Cell ID updated by the source cell.
Relationships
users → spreadsheets: One user can have multiple spreadsheets.
spreadsheets → sheets: One spreadsheet can have multiple sheets.
sheets → cells: One sheet contains multiple cells.
cells → cell_dependencies: Tracks relationships between cells for formula recalculations.
Example Data
users
id	username	email	password	created_at
1	JohnDoe	john@example.com	hashed_password	2025-01-12 10:00:00
spreadsheets
id	user_id	name	created_at	updated_at
1	1	Sales Report	2025-01-12 10:10:00	2025-01-12 12:00:00
sheets
id	spreadsheet_id	name	created_at
1	1	Sheet1	2025-01-12 10:15:00
cells
id	sheet_id	row	col	value	formula	created_at
1	1	1	1	100		2025-01-12 10:20:00
2	1	1	2	200		2025-01-12 10:20:00
3	1	1	3	300	=SUM(A1:B1)	2025-01-12 10:25:00
cell_dependencies
id	source_cell_id	dependent_cell_id
1	1	3
2	2	3
Scaling Considerations
Normalization: The structure avoids data duplication while maintaining flexibility for large spreadsheets.
Formula Evaluation: cell_dependencies ensures efficient recalculations when a cell value changes.
Indexing: Add indexes on frequently queried fields like row, col, spreadsheet_id, and sheet_id for performance.
