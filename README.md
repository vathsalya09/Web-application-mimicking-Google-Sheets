Creating a web application that mimics Google Sheets involves designing an intuitive user interface (UI) and implementing core spreadsheet functionalities. Here's how you can approach it:

                                                                                Tech Stack
1.Frontend:
         Framework: React.js (for modular, component-based UI).
         State Management: Redux or React Context (to handle data and dependencies).
         Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material UI (to create a professional and clean design similar to Google Sheets).
2.Backend:
         Node.js (Express.js) for APIs.
         Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store spreadsheet data.
3.Spreadsheet Engine:
         Utilize libraries like HyperFormula (open-source spreadsheet calculation engine) for formula parsing, evaluation, and dependency management.
4.Deployment:
         Host on platforms like Vercel (frontend) and AWS/Heroku (backend).
                                                                            Development Plan
1. Spreadsheet Interface
    -->UI/UX Design:
              Create a grid structure using CSS Grid or a library like react-data-grid to represent the spreadsheet.
              Implement a toolbar (for formatting options) and a formula bar for data entry and calculations.
              Design layout to include row/column headers, scrollbars, and a tab-like structure for multiple sheets.
    -->Core Features:
              Cell selection: Allow single and multiple-cell selection with mouse/keyboard.
              Editable cells: Enable direct input and editing.
              Cell resizing: Use drag-and-resize for rows and columns.
              Styling options: Implement bold, italics, font size, and cell coloring in the toolbar.
2. Drag Functions
    -->Cell Dragging:
              Implement drag functionality for formulas and values using mouse events. For example:
              Select a cell and drag its corner to copy data or apply a formula to adjacent cells.
              Use dependency tracking to auto-update formulas.
3. Cell Dependencies
    -->Formula Evaluation:

               Use HyperFormula to handle formula parsing and evaluation.
               Track dependencies between cells to trigger updates when referenced cells are changed.
               Provide error handling for circular references or invalid formulas.
    -->Reactivity:
               Implement a real-time update mechanism using WebSockets or polling to ensure data stays synchronized.
4. Basic Formatting
   -->Toolbar options:
               Bold, Italics, Underline.
               Font size and color picker for text and cell background.
               Update CSS styles dynamically when the formatting toolbar options are applied.
5. Row/Column Management
    -->Adding/Deleting Rows and Columns:
               Create UI buttons or right-click context menu to add/remove rows and columns.
    -->Resizing:
                Allow drag-and-resize for rows/columns by capturing mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup events.
                                                                      Project Structure
Frontend
   -->Components:
             SpreadsheetGrid: The main grid layout.
             Toolbar: Toolbar for formatting and adding functionality.
             FormulaBar: Input for formulas.
             SheetTabs: Manage multiple sheets.
    -->State:
             Keep a centralized state for cell data, styles, and formulas.
Backend
    -->APIs:
             Save and load spreadsheet data.
             Store formulas, dependencies, and formatting options.
    -->Database:
           Store each sheet as a collection/table.
           Columns: CellID, Value, Formula, Styles.
Testing
Unit Tests: Use Jest for components.
E2E Tests: Use Cypress to simulate user interactions.
